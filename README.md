# GreatStourSite

## To run
`npm start` and `npm run wp:watch`

## Database
- Set up mysql locally.
- Run the `Schema.sql` to create the DB and tables.
- When the server is started the tables will populate.

##Â Security Considerations
- We have built a database library that is safe from SQL injection.
- We have store any private keys as environment variables and not commited them to the repo at any point.
- We have encrypted the emails with AES-256, which is the current TLS/SSL standard.
